# CalendarNoteGUI_JAVA
A Swing Appointment Reminder Application
Write a GUI program by creating a JFrame that has a visual month calendar and an editor. When you click on the date (say 22-April 2012 as shown in figure) you should see some appointment notes in the editor that you added earlier. You should be able to add and retrieve notes through the editor. If there is a Java calendar widget in Java libraries you can use it in your program. Add an appropriate header for your application.
